## **`venv`** vs **`virtualenv`**
- **`venv`** : A package in the Python Standard Library (starting with Python 3.3) for creating [Virtual Environments]
- **`virtualenv`** : virtualenv is a tool which uses the command-line path environment variable to create isolated Python [Virtual Environments], much as venv does. virtualenv provides additional functionality, compared to venv, by supporting Python 2.7 and by providing convenient features for configuring, maintaining, duplicating, and troubleshooting the virtual environments. 

For more information, see the section on [Creating Virtual Environments].
