λ pipx completions

Add the appropriate command to your shell's config file
so that it is run on startup. You will likely have to restart
or re-login for the autocompletion to start working.

bash:
    eval "$(register-python-argcomplete pipx)"

zsh:
    To activate completions for zsh you need to have
    bashcompinit enabled in zsh:

    autoload -U bashcompinit
    bashcompinit

    Afterwards you can enable completion for pipx:

    eval "$(register-python-argcomplete pipx)"

tcsh:
    eval `register-python-argcomplete --shell tcsh pipx`

fish:
    # Not required to be in the config file, only run once
    register-python-argcomplete --shell fish pipx >~/.config/fish/completions/pipx.fish
```
